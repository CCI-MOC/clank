# Group vars example directory

# WARNING! This folder is part of a generated example to show off what a completed group_vars folder _might_ look like.
- *If you do not modify the 'hosts' file and the files in the group_vars folder, your instance deployment may not perform as expected.*
- The names of each file in your group_vars should match the names used in the hosts file.
- After modifying the necessary files in this directory, save it somewhere else and provide the directory path to clank as ANSIBLE_GROUP_VARS_FOLDER
- For details on how to fill out a group_vars file, open one of the examples.

For more details on ansible hosts and group_vars, see http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups
